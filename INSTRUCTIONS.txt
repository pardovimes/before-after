Use the Symfony framework to build an API endpont that accepts a Team ID, and returns a JSON with the info of its youngest player:
{
	"name": "PAULINHO", (name in uppercase)
        "position": "Central Midfield",
        "jerseyNumber": 15,
        "dateOfBirth": "1988-07-25",
        "nationality": "Brazil",
        "contractUntil": "2021-06-30"
}

Name must be returned in uppercase.
You should get the info from the following API: http://api.football-data.org/v1 (doc in https://www.football-data.org/documentation).

*Bonus: design the code in a way that the source of data could be interchangable (today is an external API, but tomorrow it could be a cache, a database, or the filesystem).

*Bonus2: limit the query only to a competition called "Primera Division 2018", a query to any team that doesn't belong to this competition should return a 404.
